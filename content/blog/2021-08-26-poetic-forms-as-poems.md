Here are some poetic instructions on how to write in classic poetic forms. I will post at the end of each poem a link to a more comprehensive lesson on the form.

**Terza Rima:**

First you start with three lines

Then you find a way

To make the first and last rhyme



The middle gives you room to play

Until the next triplet comes along,

Then that middle rhyme has to stay.

A fourth line added means no new thoughts belong.

**Heroic Quatrain:**

So say you find yourself an old churchyard,

or perhaps a knight upon a noble steed,

you wouldn't find it sad or very hard

to produce a nice quatrain to read.



Pentameter does lend a helping hand,

and so do four stanzas of four neat lines; 

and if you want to add your own new brand

just change the ABAB scheme and you'll do fine.

**Ruba'i (Persian) Quatrain:**

A cousin to our friend the quatrain, old

Ruba'i belongs to lands well known for gold

Old Persian wealth perfumes this verse and tells

New stories night and day with pens so bold.

**Ottava Rima:**

As Yeats knows well, the heart of poetry

is often found in form. Ottava Rima,

"The poet's dream," protects this heart, but he

also knows to slant his rhymes, to dream,

and so we have a special symmetry

as well as an extra line and schema

with which we write to our young hearts' desire

bad poetry, to greatness it only aspires.

**Rhyme Royale:**

A classy way to write your lover

is and will never be the rhyme royale.

At first it was G. Chaucer who wrote in his

old books, Lord Henry soon declared: "This shall

be called Rhime Royale!" Seven lines - no grand mal - 

The final two tie up old thoughts with ease - 

Use pentameter and you can do what you please.

**Spenserian Stanza**:

Unique in its own right, this stanza climbs

and curls like vines and five feet long it wraps 

its body tight around a trunk of rhymes.

Ed Spenser does his best to suck the sap

from trees of words, which makes me think perhaps

if I were too to love this verse, and take

its vines into my hands, lay them on my lap, 

and sit and let them climb my brain, and make

me feel at home, my page would be at once awake.

**Ballad (just a ballad, just for  fun):** 

Now gather round and let me tell

the tale of Danny Wise:

And how his sweet wife Annabelle

did suck out both his eyes.



And if I tell the story true

and if I tell it clear

There's not a mortal one of you

won't shriek with mortal fear.



Before she sucked his eyes right out, 

she called him her true love,

and after that she cried aloud

"YOU NEVER SAY THE SAME



I saw you look at that 

old dame who lives across the street

so now I'm eating both your eyes

instead of eating meat!"
