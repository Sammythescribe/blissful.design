Hello everyone! I probably should have mentioned in my first post that I am writing a creativity series for my first few posts on this blog. Each entry will focus on a different part of my life that I like to be creative in. I am hoping to hear from y’all about which of the posts is your favorite. That way I can go into more detail about that topic and maybe even find a more cohesive theme for this page.



This week I am writing about creative reading. I feel like many people think reading is just a skill that we acquire in grade school. And, with creative writing being seen as an art form, hobbyists and teachers don’t really address creative reading. Readers, not writers, are in charge of the reading process. We each have our own style. We pick different books, engage with different types of writers, and read at all variations of speed and enjoyment.



Without further ado, here are 9 tips on how to read creatively:



1. Imagination

The imagination is when the mind calls forth stored memories and recreates them behind the mind’s eye. As creative readers, we should make the effort to use our imagination as much as possible. Put yourself into the story by actively calling forth all your memories to create powerful images for yourself.



Imagination Exercise:If you find your imagination getting sleepy, try re-inventing little details in whatever you are reading. If the writer says a girl has black hair and is really thin, but I don’t think that fits her character, I just change her to a tall blonde. You can do this with lots of side details that aren’t important to plot, such as meals the characters are having. It’s a great way to jump start your imagination.



2. Don’t Read on a Schedule

Don’t worry about finishing chapters or novels. If you are enjoying a book, you won’t have to force yourself to finish anything. If you aren’t enjoying a book, I suggest you move on. The classics aren’t for everyone, and the sticky romance that Susan recommended you read because it’s justamazingis actually annoyingly written. Just move on to something you like.



3. Take Notes

Write down anything important. What makes you laugh, what doesn’t make sense? What would you change? My favorite way to take notes is to use an index card as a bookmark. I write down quotes as I go along. At the end of my book, I have a nice collection of my favorite moments and sayings to look back on! I use these quotes to help with my response (see tip 9).



4. Google Things

Vocabulary, author’s biography, series trivia, film adaptations, fan art, literary criticism, controversy, related titles, and much more.



5. Read in Different Places

We all have our favorite spot, but I like to try reading in different places. Even though I am using my imagination and am not really \~on this earth\~ when I read, it’s fun to go outside or take a bath as opposed to just sitting on the couch.

6. Try Genres Out of Your Comfort Zone

A genre I suggest to everyone is poetry. People find poetry intimidating, but I like how much space it provides for the reader to take their own liberties with it.



An introduction to reading poetry (from an English major): Don’t try to understand it. Just read it out loud (please, half of poetry is the way it feels in your body), enjoy the way it feels and sounds, and then circle some of your favorite words or images. There. That was easy.



7. Join a Discussion Group

If you’re not lucky enough to have someone in your life who shares your taste in reading, there are plenty of places online to find a good discussion group such as facebook and goodreads. You can go to your group to share your struggles, notes, and google searches.



8. Read Under the Influence

If you are of age, just try it. Your imagination will have a whole new attitude.



9. Respond Through Art

When you finish your reading: cook a meal or prepare a drink from the book, make a music playlist for your favorite character, write a poem, draw, paint, dress up as your favorite character, write a screenplay, write your own novel, write a critical essay, post a review on your [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) profile.



Let your reading actively inspire you to be creative in your own life. Use whatever you are taking in to contribute more art to the world. It doesn’t have to be anything big, you don’t have to share it with anyone, just make the effort to respond creatively.
